=begin
in this project you will be creating a program that tells people what grade they will need on a test to get a particular overall grade in the class. Look at the pseudocode below as an example of how the the UI is and how the calculation works
=end

#Example 1

#My current overall grade is 80/100
# my next test is worth 20 points
# I want to know what grade I will need on the test in order to keep a C in the class
# I know that the overall points in the class will be 120
# and that 120*.7 is 84 so I will need a 4/20, or 20% on the next test to maintain a 70% in the class.


#Example 2

# my current grade is 45/50, a 90%
# I want to know how to move to a 95% if my next test is worth 25 points
# I know that my overall grade will be out of 75 points, and .95 of 75 is 71.25
# so the person will need 71.25-45=26.5 points on the next test or 106% to get a 95%
